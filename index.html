	  <h2>About John</h2>
	  <p>After graduating with a B.S. Biology degree from Indiana University in 2013 I took a position as a phlebotomist at BioLife Plasma Services. After nearly 6 years there, having held roles such as Quality Assurance Lead and Center Supervisor, I realized I wanted to work in an industry that allowed me to build things. I spent a year as an Apprentice Carpenter and enjoyed all the new skills I was learning. At that time I realized that I could combine my desire to create things with my strong sense of quality and my passion for all things tech into my dream job as a Software Developer.
	  <p>As a new student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> I am already learning so many new and interesting things. I'm excited to begin working, growing, and learning with my classmates and mentors!</p>
	  <p>When I'm not digging into coding tutorials on my computer or in a book I can usually be found in the mountains or deserts of Utah with my camera.</p>
