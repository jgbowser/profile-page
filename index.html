	  <h2>About John</h2>
	  <p>After graduating with a B.S. Biology degree from Indiana University in 2013 I took a position as a phlebotomist at BioLife Plasma Services. After nearly 6 years there, having held roles such as Quality Assurance Lead and Center Supervisor, I realized I wanted to work in an industry that allowed me to build things. I spent a year as an Apprentice Carpenter and enjoyed all the new skills I was learning. At that time I realized that I could combine my desire to create things with my strong sense of quality and my passion for all things tech into my dream job as a Software Developer.
	  <p>At <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> I spent 6 months fully immersed in learning full stack software engineering/web development. Through a focus on building projects and group work I quickly learned how to develop software as part of a team and utilize version control technology like git and GitHub effectively. I gained experience in a variety of languages, frameworks, and technologies. I love working with React and am learning other frameworks either built on, or related to it, like Gatsby and Vue. I also gained a lot of experience with plain HTML5/CSS3, vanilla JavaScript, SQL, React Router, jQuery, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Jest, Mocha, Chai, Cypress, NPM, VS Code, command line, a variety of popular libraries, and deploys using SaaS like Vercel and Heroku.</p>
	  <p>When I'm not digging into coding tutorials or working on personal projects I can usually be found in the mountains or deserts of Utah with my girlfriend and my camera.</p>

			<p class="card-description"><strong>Description:</strong> This app lets user's create accounts and practice learning spanish using the spaced repetition technique. This was a pair programming project built to practice working on projects with other people. The algorithm for the spaced repetition was developed by us and utilized a linked list data structure to handle tracking the placement of the words in the "deck." Persistance of user progress was handled with a relational database using PostgreSQL. The app is scalable and allows for the addition of more words and different languages. The app was a fun exercise in developing algorithms, building and using linked lists, and pair programming. It was built as fall was kicking in and we hope you enjoy the halloween theme.<br>
